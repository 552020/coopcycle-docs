# Shops

A shop enables a shop-owner to create deliveries through a backoffice. The price of the delivery is calcuted according to the tarification which is associated to the shop by an administrator. The shops don't have for the moment a public page which enable an end customer to directly order

The page `Shops` lists the shops which were configured on the platform. A shop-owner will display a list of shops that he manages. The list of shops displays :
- Button : To create un shop
- ID, link towards the shop
- Name of the shop
- Adresse of the shop
- Tarification
- Timetable

## Creation / management of a shop

Only administrators can create a shop. Shop-owners can only configure parameters of their shop and engage orders. The creation of a shop displays these options :
- To upload a picture
- Name of the sop
- Legal name of the shop
- Website
- Telephone number
- Siret number

Every shop is associated to a tarification. See `tarifications` part for further informations.

A button which is above the informations of the shop enables a shop-owner to create an order. Therefore, an order can be created by an administrator or by a shop-owner. The price of the delivery is calculated thanks to the tarification associated to the shop
